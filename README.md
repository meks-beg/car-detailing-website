# car-detailing-website

# 🔹 Hello 👋

  ### :small_orange_diamond: My name is Mensur Begović, I am student at Internacionalna poslovno-informaciona akademija Tuzla (Computer science) and *this is my first web development project*.
  
  ### :small_orange_diamond: I look forward to learning more and more about web development and becoming a better programmer along the way.

# 🔹 Why did I make this project ❓:

  ### :small_orange_diamond: A friend of mine started a business, car detailing to be exact and I thought it would be a good idea to make him a website which would benefit the both of us: he would have a website for his start-up, and I would gain some experience, practice and a project under my name! 😄

# 🔹 Purpose of this website 📜:

  ### :small_orange_diamond: It's purely front-end website, I've made it to showcase my friend's business and him as an owner of that business.
  
  ### :small_orange_diamond: There is no back-end logic (login, registration, users, database, etc.).
  
  ### :small_orange_diamond: Like I previously said, this is my first website that I used to practice and gain some real-world experience.

# 🔹 About the code I've written in this project 💻:

  ### :small_orange_diamond: I've made this website using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS.
  
  ### :small_orange_diamond: I have also integrated **Google Maps API** to show the location of his business.
  
  ### :small_orange_diamond: I know it's not the prettiest looking code you'll ever see, but hey, it's my first website and it works 😆
